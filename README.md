# Market-Segmentation

Market segmentation is a marketing strategy in which select groups of consumers are identified so that certain products or product lines can be presented to them in a way that appeals to their interests.

Objective :
This project requires to develop a customer segmentation to give recommendations like saving plans, loans, wealth management among other influencial variables on target customer groups.

Data Description :
About 9000 active credit card users' usage patterns during the last six months are summarised in the sample dataset. The file contains 18 behavioural characteristics at the consumer level.

Algorithms Used:
1. K-Means Clustering
2. Agglomerative Clustering
3. DBScan Clustering

Final Model :
Based on this clustering technique, we have developed a Streamlit application where we take the customer's information and determine which cluster the client belongs to.
